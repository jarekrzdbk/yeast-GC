\section{Introduction}

\input{text-parts/intro.tex}
Yeast strains were taken from \href{http://sgd-archive.yeastgenome.org/}{Saccharomyces Genome Database} ~\cite{Engel2013} 

\section{Methods}
Yeast genome was subject of interest for some time ~\cite{DUJON1996263} ~\cite{Dujon2004} ~\cite{Dujon2017} \\
In this repository solution was developed to calculate GC ratio in ORFs of 3 yeast strains. \\
First fasta files for unfolded using fasta-unfold script, then content of unfolded files was passed to find-orfs script,
which looked for ORFs, then GC content ratio were calculated.
generate-plot.R script generated plots from gc files, ggplot2 library was used to draw plots.
resulting plots look similar to plots presented in research done by Lynch ~\cite{Lynch2010}. \\
All scripts are run automatically with make, and report and presentation pdfs are created. \\
All code was uploaded to GitHub to the \href{https://github.com/jarekrzdbk/yeast-GC}{yeast-GC} repository, 
GitHub Actions pipeline was added that installs dependencies on agent and run  make, gc and pdfs are uploaded as artifacts.
